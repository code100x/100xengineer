# Language Model Agent Platform

This project creates an experimental platform giving an agent access to compute and coding resources. It utilizes a React-based frontend, an Express backend, and integrates the LangchainJS agent library with GPT-3.5, managed and orchestrated using Kubernetes (k8s).

## Features

- **React Frontend**: A dynamic user interface for interacting with the language model.
- **Express Backend**: A server-side application handling requests to the language model and returning responses.
- **LangchainJS Agent Library**: Integration layer for interacting with GPT-3.5, providing a bridge between the frontend and the model.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Scalable and manageable deployment of resources, ensuring the agent has access to the compute resources it needs.

## Getting Started
